## Puspose of this repo:
- For me to learn C++.
- To create compute and memory efficient graph theoretical simulators of social networks.
- To be able to perform Graph ML over arbitrary graph structures, treating the social networks as if they were probabilistic models, or Bayesian Networks, thereby enabling beleif propagation and Bayesian Inference and other graph operations over the network.
- To visualise dynamic networks somehow.

## Strogatz consists of:
- utils.h
- utils.cpp
- entity.h
- entity.cpp
- main.cpp

# To do:
- Entity propagation.
- Refactor and functionalise main.
- Split rendering and event handling out in to seperate threads.
- Data representation of networks.
- Meaningful visual entity representation.
- Add entity AI.
- Add environments.
- Add an economy.
- Add a player.
- ...etc
